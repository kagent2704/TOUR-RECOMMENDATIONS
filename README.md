# TOUR-RECOMMENDATIONS

Most of the time when we seek to make a vacation plan, we are almost always confused while choosing the right destinations for the right seasons and have trouble making a concise plan about lodging and travel necessities. Thus, learning from our own experiences, we thought of finding a solution that gives you a detailed itinerary and allows you to make informed choices!

This website is specifically designed to explore the Great Indian heritage based on the three main seasons of the country: Summer, Monsoon and Winter. 

Thus, we have sorted the Indian states based on their peak travel periods and compiled them into categories such as North, South, East and West for each season. 

The website uses extensive CSS and JS to incorporate seamless navigation and give users an interface that is both intuitive and appealing to the eye. 

We also use forms to collect information about the users and their travel details such as travel dates, number of adults, children and the state they'd like to visit. 

Then, using the email ID they provide, we send them a computer-generated PDF containing the details and the approximate cost of travel. We also aim to provide the users with options for the quality of hotels they'd like to choose to live in and even the travel options, all in the pdf. 

Additionally, to help our users make informed choices, we have introduced links to official tourism pages for all the states, so that the user can safely and securely explore their options all while relying on genuine resources.
